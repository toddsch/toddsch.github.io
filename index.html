		<!-- Short biography of my career -->
		<section class="card" id="bio">
			<p>Growing up, I always felt at peace around technology. It's a comfortable thing to know that, in the chaos of life, you can rely on something to generate the same outcome every time, no matter what.</p>

			<p>Well... that's what I thought until I started writing software.</p>

			<p>Since shattering my entire view of the world, I've put my all into developing applications in several areas of focus:</p>

			<p>
				<ul>
					<li>GPS & iBeacon</li>
					<li>Cryptocurrency</li>
					<li>Social Media</li>
					<li>Food Recipe Handling</li>
					<li>Music Player</li>
					<li>Chat bot</li>
					<li>Language learning</li>
					<li>many more, soon...</li>
				</ul>
			</p>

			<p>I've been writing software since 2011. Since graduating from university, I've worked with a startup dealing with Bitcoin in Kamloops, British Columbia and wrote software to compare prices of cryptocurrency across several exchanges.</p>

			<p>After that I found myself living overseas in Shanghai, China (wow!) where I spearheaded the design and development of a new social app, <i>Magnet</i>. Using GPS, iBeacon tech and general surroundings, it connected nearby people to a central forum for that location &mdash; typically tied to a venue.</p>

			<p>During my time at Magnet I also worked for their sister company <i>OpenLanguage</i> where I deployed standard bugfixes for their flagship app. I also designed and developed a "Lite" version of their app (named <i>Kaiyan</i>) meant only for playing and maintaining a personal library of podcasts from OpenLanguage.</p>

			<p>I've since returned to Canada and picked up contract work where available: for Bitnational, a company in Vancouver that specializes in operating a network of bitcoin ATMs. When not working professionally I'll chip away at ongoing personal projects, like a chatbot to use with my friends or a music player app; really, anything that comes to mind and sounds interesting or challenging.</p>

			<p>Finally, I have no experience with it yet, but I keep noticing AI staring me down from the horizon. Soon.</p>
